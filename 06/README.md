Transformers 2 (ssmlToSpeech) -> converts SSML to spoken words. Commands (execute command directive)

## Concepts
- Transformers (ssmlToSpeech, ssmlToText)
- Execute Command Directive and Tokens

## Documents
- template7 + datasource4: datasource now includes a new transformer (ssmlToSpeech). Text item in central layout now includes id (for reference by execute command directive) and speech property. textSpeech is generated by ssmlToSpeech, contains a url to an mp3 and is passed as parameter to the speech property of the tex item in the central layout. text is now generated by ssmlToText

## Model
- No changes

Note on transformers: 
1) ssmlToSpeech converts a data source value to a text-to-speech URL, and 2) ssmlToText converts an SSML expression to plain text by stripping out any SSML tags.
